Upon analysis, several key findings quickly revealed a dataset of little utility. The analysis of average exercise intensity across different exercise categories showed very minimal variance which is highly unusual.  Ten diffrent exercises should elicit a much greater variance as is consistent in the established science. The evaluation of average heart rate per exercise category also displayed very little variance again in a very unusual fashion as compared to well esatablished expectations.  Finally, the examination of the relationship between age and heart rate revealed no significant decrease in heart rate as a function of age, contradicting the well-established physiological expectation that heart rate typically decreases with age during exercise. This is a well established study expectation. These combined findings indicate that this dataset is unreliable and unworthy of time investment for further analysis.
